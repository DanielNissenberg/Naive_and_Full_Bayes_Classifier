First part -
Normal Naive Bayes Classifier Vs Normal Full Bayes Classifier
Comparasion between the two models on a given data set.
* Naive Bayes Classifier based on Multi-Normal distribution
* Full Bayes Classifier based on Multi-Normal distribution

The data used is observation of a certain type of animal.
1000 days of meaurements of temperature and humidity and whether the animal was spotted or not.

Second part-
Implementing a Discrete Naive Bayes Classifier using Laplace smoothing.
This model tries to predict breast cancer from the Breast Cancer Dataset 'https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/breast+cancer'.
